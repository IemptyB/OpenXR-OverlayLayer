shared_ptr guarantees thread-safe control - deletion, copy, reset, etc.
    https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/atomic-smart-pointers#:~:text=yes%20and%20no.-,Why%3F,will%20be%20deleted%20exactly%20once.
    But OBJECT is still not thread safe.
    all members could be private and all methods take the lock
        init-only const accessors for private members (need to put in ctor) - no locking
        otherwise return-by-value and set functions would lock in order to be atomic / exclusive

8/12 You're in the middle of figuring out whether things have smart pointers or not (in particular ConnectionToOverlay and gConnectionsToOverlayByProcessId)
Make as many objects simple copies as possible (e.g. RPCConnections is just HANDLEs and DWORDs and void*s)
Use std::thread to make sure to avoid conflict with Windows threads
    do I need thread HANDLEs for anything?
use std::mutex within a process
    use CreateMutex only for cross-process synchronization and sparingly
Identity any objects that may be accessed by multiple threads and why
    unordered_maps mapping handles to tracking state must be locked
        will be appended from negotiation thread
        may have elements removed by overlay service thread
    map of overlay thread ID to overlay state
    list of overlay-owned objects in main process does *not* need to be locked?
        they will only get destroyed in the overlay service thread?  What about 
Why not just lock every API layer call?
    Why?  Only Destroy has to be externally synchronized.  That means we won't be inside an XR command in an app's explicit threads when the handle is Destroyed.
        But we could be in the overlay service thread accessing, say XrSession, when it is Destroyed. 


Any RPC should check for Main Instance lost, return INSTANCE_LOST and Overlay convert to INITIALIZATION_FAILED

CreateSession is an RPC Call
    parameters are:
        const XrInstanceCreateInfo*                 instanceCreateInfo;
        const XrSessionCreateInfo*                  createInfo;
        XrSession*                                  session;
    sendRPC["instanceCreateInfo"] = "%(member)s = gOverlaysLayerXrInstanceToHandleInfo.at(*instance).createInfo;\n"
    sendRPC["instanceCreateInfo"] = "%(member)s = gOverlaysLayerXrInstanceToHandleInfo.at(*instance).createInfo;\n"
    if not annotated, parameters are from and then to command call
    otherwise parameters annoted with "sendRPC" and "receiveRPC" for code to insert before RPC and after

OverlaysLayerLogMessage
    should key on instance, so that MainAsOverlay calls OverlaysLogMessage with remote instance and it is known to route there
    should key on any proxy objects, so that if runtime encounters any issues, proxy debug messenger can send to overlay...?

DestroySession

destroying main session
    poison all overlay IPC using ConnectionToOverlay
    SetEvent(gNegotiationChannels.mainNegotiateThreadStop);
    WaitForSingleObject(gNegotiationChannels.mainThread, INFINITE);
    gMainSessionInstance = XR_NULL_HANDLE;
    ReleaseMutex(gNegotiationChannels.mainMutexHandle);

destroying instance that was used to create main session
    if(instance == gMainSessionInstance) {
        call same functions as destroy main session
    }

Actions have arbitrary names and arbitrary localizedNames
    a runtime may not know how to figure out how to map a controller input to an Action

Applications "may" suggest interaction profile bindings
    SuggestInteractionProfileBindings provides a tuple {interaction_profile path, binding path, action}
        EnumerateBoundSourcesForAction provides 0 or more source binding paths for an action
            source binding paths can be changed into strings
            each can be compared against other interaction profile binding path strings
    if bindings aren't suggested, input can't be routed because runtime has no idea what actions mean what
    So, for a given action, IF AN INTERACTION PROFILE BINDING HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, one may reverse-lookup 0 or more interaction profile binding paths for the action.
        e.g. in hello_xr, grabAction for interaction profiles is the following bindings:
            "/interaction_profiles/khr/simple_controller"
                "/user/hand/left/input/select/click"
                "/user/hand/right/input/select/click"
            "/interaction_profiles/oculus/touch_controller"
                "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/value"
                "/user/hand/right/input/squeeze/value"
            "/interaction_profiles/htc/vive_controller"
                "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/click"
                "/user/hand/right/input/squeeze/click"
            "/interaction_profiles/microsoft/motion_controller" (bindings same as htc/vive_controller)
                "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/click"
                "/user/hand/right/input/squeeze/click"
        The list of Paths for a given action can be refined further by using the current interaction profile name
            e.g. if one knows the interaction profile is oculus/touch_controller, then one can know that grabAction is {left,right}/input/squeeze/value
            if one does not know the interaction profile, then what?
                Just check all of them?
        further a subactionpath might disambiguate fully mapping an action to a binding
        if overlay suggests "select/click" for XrAction bar and main suggests "select/click" for XrAction foo, xrGetActionStateBoolean on bar could return the same as for foo.
    However, an app may suggest only khr/simple_controller and not the others.
        what if overlay suggests "khr/simple_controller" "select/click" for XrAction bar, and main suggests "oculus/touch_controller" "squeeze/value" for XrAction foo.
            Should OverlaysLayer be responsible for converting input profiles?
                xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile would need to translate from oculus/touch_controller to khr/simplecontroller
                xrGetActionStateBoolean would need to know {"oculus/touch_controller","squeeze/value"} can be reasonably approximated by {"khr/simple_controller","select/click"}
                Overlay Layer would need a mapping with entries from {main profile, main binding} to {overlay profile, overlay binding}
                if main suggests bindings in a profile that Overlay Layer doesn't know, probably have to punt for now.
                Maybe punt in general if main's selected interaction profile is not suggested at all by overlay.
    overlay XrActions may not have the same types as main XrActions for the same bindings.
        May be able to do conversions one direction but not the other..
        punt here too if they don't match?
    An overlay app may suggest bindings for a profile that don't 100% overlap with 100% of main app's bindings
        also punt, I guess.  Some overlay app Actions won't then receive input.
    Finally, an XrAction may be bound to multiple input paths.  See 11.5.1 - "Resolving a single action bound to multiple inputs or outputs" for how that's resolved
    XrAction -> look up in suggested interaction bindings, refine by current interaction profile, results in >= 0 profile paths
        need to catch profile changed event 

If the Overlay knows what main XrActions are bound to which paths at the moment of xrGetActionState*, it can call xrGetActionState on the main XrAction.
    this won't work until main calls xrSyncActions, or if main calls xrSyncActions... at all?
        Overlay could have main call xrSyncActions if main hasn't called it already, and skip the next main xrSyncActions.
        Is it safe to call twice?
    Overlay will need to read state of all XrActions at xrSyncActions and keep locally, otherwise a call by main to xrSyncActions would make subsequent xrGetActionState calls return inconsistent results.
